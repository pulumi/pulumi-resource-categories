# Pulumi Resource Categories

This project categorizes various Pulumi resources into predefined categories such as `Compute`, `Storage`, `Network`, etc. It helps in organizing and managing resources more effectively.

## Usage

To get the category of a resource type, use the `GetResourceKind` function. This function takes a resource type string as input and returns the corresponding `ResourceKind`.
